# KiCad HOWTO

KiCad is one of the most famous EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software.
This is mainly developed and supported my CERN. It provides a full set of
PCB design tools, including shcematic, PCB footprint, and 3D model generation.
The best thing about KiCad is absolutly free.

However, it comes at a price. I mean it is not easy to get used to it.
Especially, there are a lot of _very_ tricky thing you would hardly figure out 
(seriously.) So I highly recommend going there some tutorials. By the way, do
not try to read manuals. It is not worth time :P
